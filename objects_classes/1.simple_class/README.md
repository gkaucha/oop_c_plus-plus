## Classes and Objects

1. Structures provides way to group data elements.
2. An object has the same relationship to a class that a variable has to a data type.
3. An object is an *instance* of a class, in the same way *Toyota Corolla Cross* is an instance of a vehicle.
4. Data constructs such as structures and classes end with a semicolon, while control constructs such as functions and loops do not.
5. One of the key feature of OOP is **data  hiding**. It means data is concealed within the class and cannot be accessed by functions outside the class.
6. *Private data or Functions* can only be accessed from within the class. While *Public data or functions* are accessible from outside the class.

7. There can be any number of data items (data members) within a class.
8. **Member Function** are functions included within a class.

9. Generally **Functions are Public, Data is Private** but there is no rule as such. In some cases we may need to use private function and public data.

10. Definition of the class doesn't create objects. Defining an object is similar to defining a variable of any data type: space is created for it in memory.

11. Objects are simply *instance variables* as they get created when an instance of the class is created.

12. Member function should always be called in connection with an object of this class. Dot Operator(the period or *class member access operatoir*) connects the object name and the member function.

### Program examples

### Keywords

- class 
- private
- public


### Notes

- Data hiding means one class's data is hidden from other classes. It is designed to prevent unintentional access or accidental manipulation of data.

- **Inline Functions** are member functions defined inside a class for which memory is set aside only when an object of the class is created.

- It is also possible to *declare* a function within a class but to *define* it elsewhere.
